# 1.3 HTTP

## Introduction to HTTP:
- **HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is a networking protocol run over TCP/IP and governs communications between web browsers and web servers.

- **Transmissions Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)** is a protocol suite that governs how data packets are transferred over the internet from one machine to another.

Before HTTP communication works, the web browser performs a **DNS lookup** by sending the domain name to the local DNS and getting back the IP address of the web server hosting the domain name.

HTTP functions as a request-response protocol between web browsers and web servers:
- **HTTP request** is a message sent from the web browser to the web server.
- **HTTP response** is a message sent from the web server back to the web browser in response to an HTTP request.

## Request and response headers:
HTTP requests and responses are composed of four parts:
1. Start line - The __start line__ specifies the HTTP version
	  - A request's start line includes a request type and path
	  - A response's start line includes status code and phrase
2. Zero or more header fields - a __header field__ is a keyword followed by a colon and a value.
	 - Header fields supply additional information about the request or response
3. A blank line
4. Optional message body - A __message body__ contains data being transferred between a web browser and web server.
    - a request, the message body may be empty or contain submitted form data.
	- In a response, the message body may contain the requested source

#### Chrome DevTools for watching HTTP traffic:

> All popular web browsers contain built-in developer tools. Developers can access __Chrome's developer tools (DevTools)__ by pressing Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows) Or command-option-I (Mac). 


### Request methods and response status codes:
- An HTTP __request method__ indicates the desired action to perform on a resource.
Common HTTP request methods:

| Request method | Meaning                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET            | Request a representation of the specified resource.                 |
| HEAD           | Request a response identical to GET but without the response body.  |
| POST           | Create a new resource with the contents of the message body.        |
| PATCH          | Modify an existing resource with the contents of the message body.  |
| PUT            | Replace an existing resource with the contents of the message body. |
| DELETE         | Delete an existing resource.                                        |

- An HTTP response __status code__ is a three digit number that indicates the status of the requested resource.
- A __browser redirect__ is when the web server returns a 301 or 302 status code with _Location_ header indicating the URL the browser should load next.

| Status code | Status phrase         | Meaning                                                                            |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200         | OK                    | Standard response for a successful request.                                        |
| 301         | Moved Permanently     | The resource should always be requested at a different URL.                        |
| 302         | Found                 | The resource should temporarily be requested at a different URL.                   |
| 304         | Not Modified          | The resource has not been modified since the last time the resource was requested. |
| 403         | Forbidden             | The web browser does not have permission to access the resource.                   |
| 404         | Not Found             | The resource could not be located.                                                 |
| 500         | Internal Server Error | Something unexpected happened on the web server.                                   |

### URL shortening 
- __URL shortening__ is a technique to create shorter URLs that redirect to longer URLs.
	- Common URL shortening services include bit.ly, rebrandly.com, and tinyurl.com
