# 1.1 Web History
# Notes
- The **internet** began as four networked computer in 1969
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** early days of transferring data
- [[Tim Berners-Lee]] Created the **<u>World Wide Web</u>** 
- The **web** involved three thing:
	- Text files (HTML files) linking to other text files.
	- Browser for viewing HTML files
	- Rules known as the HTTP protocol for transferring files.

A webpage or web page is a document that is viewed in a web browser. A collection of related webpages are organized into a **website**. A web server is a program that serves a webpages to web browsers

## Introduction to HTML
HyperText markup language (HTML) is the standard markup language for web documents. [[Hypertext]] is text that links to other text (or images, videos, and more). Document markup is special markings in the document that provide additional information about links, formatting, and images. HTML also permits adding metadata, such as search engine keywords, author information, and language.



### Key points: The web
-  Early 1990s: The period when the web was first developed.
	- People/companies began obtaining personal computers throughout the 1980s, and networks were growing. connecting those computers intelligently was becoming important.
- HTML: The language used for a text file that describes a webpage.
	- The HyperText Markup Language has text with links (hypertext) to other files on the web.
- webpage: Web documents that is viewed in a web browser.
	- A webpage may link to other webpages.
- website: Collection of related webpages
	- A website may be composed of any number of webpages.
- Web server: A program that serves webpages to browsers.
	- Popular web servers today include Apache, IIS, and nginx.
- HTTP: The protocol for transferring files among computer via the web.
	- Short for HyperText Transfer Protocol. A protocol is a set of rules.
- browser: A program for viewing webpages.
	- A browser displays HTML files in a formatted way.

## Web vs. internet

Today, much of the internet traffic is web traffic. People thus have a hard time distinguishing the internet (the interconnection of computers communicating using a set of rules), and the web (which is just one particular use of the internet). Besides transferring webpages from one computer to another, the internet also transmits email, music, video, and other types of data.

## Browser wars and HTML standardization
A [web browser] is a program that downloads an HTML document from a web server, displays the document to the user with the appropriate formatting, and allows the user to interact with the document, such as by clicking hyperlinks to access other documents. A web browser uses HTML to understand the structure and semantics, or meaning, of the document.

Browser developers used to compete for users and would use browsing enhancements to attract users with greater interactivity, but this would lead to documents not properly displaying on certain browsers.

Frequent webpage and browser incompatibility pushed the industry to value standardization. The [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)] is the international standards organization that traditionally has controlled a number of web standards, including the HTML. HTML5 was the final HTML standard released by the W3C.

In 2019, the W3C relinquished HTML standards publishing to the [Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)], and organization that develops a variety of web standards and whose members include the major browser vendors. WHATWG produces the [HTML Living Standard], a continually evolving standard without version numbers that replaces HTML5.

A webpage that conforms to the HTML Living Standard looks and acts the same way in most modern web browsers. With standardization, browser developers now compete on browser speed, standards compliance, and browser features rather than on the basis of proprietary extensions.

### Significant points in web history:
- 1945: The idea for generating links from one document to other documents.
	- Vannevar Bush described the memory extension device, Memex, a system for building and following links between documents.
- 1965: The term HyperText invented
	- Ted Nelson introduced the term HyperText in a paper on how to deal with information that was complex, changing, and uncertain.
- 1990: First web browser is created.
	- Tim Berners-Lee created and demonstrated a browser that works over the internet.
- 1994: The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created.
	- The W3C is the official body that once developed and published HTML standards. In 1995, the W3C created the first HTML standard called HTML 2.0. The W3C is still in charge of the CSS standard.
- 2014: HTML5 standard published.
	- Work on HTML5 started in 2008. HTML5 is synonymous with modern web standards.
- 2019: HTML standard controlled by WHATWG.
	- W3C makes suggestions to WHATWG for new items to include in the HTML Living Standard.

## Separation of duties
A significant change that occurred over time was a move to separate document structure, document presentation (how the document is displayed in a browser), and webpages interaction with the user. Document markup was initially used to control document structure and appearance. Interlacing document structure with presentation and interaction complicates the ability of pages to work well across the range of technologies from large screen to small phones to printing devices.

A modern webpage is composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- HTML defines the structure and content of a webpage.
- CSS specifies the layout and visibility appearance.
- JavaScript Describes the Dynamic behaviors
