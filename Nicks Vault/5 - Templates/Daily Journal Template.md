> *When I ignore external influences and advice from anyone else, what does my intuition tell me to move toward? What is my intuition telling me to try? What feels most expansive, unknown, and aligned right now?*

## **When I encounter fear and uncertainty today, how will I handle it?**
- 

## **Mantra for the day**
- *Write a mantra to help you remember to trust and follow your intuition today.*
