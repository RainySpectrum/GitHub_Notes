# ðŸŒ… Morning â€“ Daily Intentions
Without a conscious intention to follow intuition, we default to following our conditioning. Use this section to set your focus for the day.

## **What is my intuition telling me today?**
- I need to focus and work on my assignment for school so i can get it done. While also working on myself internally to keep my cool and adapt to changing situations.

> *When I ignore external influences and advice from anyone else, what does my intuition tell me to move toward? What is my intuition telling me to try? What feels most expansive, unknown, and aligned right now?*

## **When I encounter fear and uncertainty today, how will I handle it?**
- I will try and avoid biting my fingertips and understand why I am feeling that way, and what I can do to help 

## **Mantra for the day**
- *Write a mantra to help you remember to trust and follow your intuition today.*
The hard work I do today builds my future self.

## **Reflection & Takeaways**
Now look at your **inputs** and **outputs**.  
- Do you see a relationship between them?  
- What impact did your inputs have on your outputs?  
- What patterns do you notice?  
- What are your key takeaways?  
- What is your intuition telling you?  

I don't see a relationship yet, as this is only my first day of starting and completing my daily journal. As I continue to do this I hope to improve my productivity and live a more peaceful life.
