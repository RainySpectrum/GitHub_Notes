# 🌅 Morning – Daily Intentions
Without a conscious intention to follow intuition, we default to following our conditioning. Use this section to set your focus for the day.

## **What is my intuition telling me today?**
- I need to get over myself and make phone calls even if they are stressful and make me anxious

> *When I ignore external influences and advice from anyone else, what does my intuition tell me to move toward? What is my intuition telling me to try? What feels most expansive, unknown, and aligned right now?*

## **When I encounter fear and uncertainty today, how will I handle it?**
- I will take a breath, and focus my thoughts and intentions of what I want to get done.

## **Mantra for the day**
- *Write a mantra to help you remember to trust and follow your intuition today.*
- __The hard work I do today builds my future self__
